# FjordPad-v0.5
Crappy numpad made to be 100% SLS printed.

A few things to start (please read)

1. At time of publishing I havent tested this at all. 
2. Its designed arounf this PCB by ai03 https://kbdfans.com/collections/pcb/products/kbdpad-markii-pcb
3. It needs 4 m2 screws and nuts. I designed it for socket cap head but I think others would work.
4. It has small indentations for 6mm bumpons (holes are 6.5 mm for crappy tolerences on the bumpons, just in case), they are 1mm deep holes so you can get thick pads and not have so much sticking out. (most pads are 2mm thick or more)

Thats it, enjoy!

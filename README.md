# FjordPad-v0.5
Crappy numpad made to be 100% SLS printed.

A few things to start (please read)

1. At time of publishing I havent tested this at all. 
2. Its designed arounf this PCB by ai03 https://kbdfans.com/collections/pcb/products/kbdpad-markii-pcb
3. It needs 4 m2 screws and nuts. I designed it for socket cap head but I think others would work.

Thats it, enjoy!
